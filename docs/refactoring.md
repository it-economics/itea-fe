# Refactoring Best Practices

## Establish a Clear Goal

Objective: Define what you aim to achieve with refactoring (e.g., improved readability, performance enhancements, reduced complexity).
Plan: Outline the steps and stages of the refactoring process.

## Incremental Refactoring

Small Steps: Make small, incremental changes rather than large, sweeping modifications.
Commit Often: Commit changes frequently to keep track of progress and facilitate rollbacks if necessary.

## Simplify Code

Extract Methods: Break down large methods into smaller, more manageable ones.
Remove Dead Code: Eliminate unused code and redundant functions.
Simplify Conditionals: Refactor complex conditional logic into simpler, more readable constructs.

## Refactor for Reusability

DRY Principle: Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionality.
Generic Methods: Use generic methods or templates to handle similar tasks across different parts of the codebase.

## Refactor As You Go

Boy Scout Rule: Always leave the codebase cleaner than you found it. Apply small refactoring changes whenever you work on the code.
