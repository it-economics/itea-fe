# Refactoring Best Practices

## Establish a Clear Goal

Define what you aim to achieve with refactoring (e.g., improved readability, reduced complexity).

## Incremental Refactoring

Make small, incremental changes rather than large, sweeping modifications - commit changes frequently.

## Simplify Code

Break down large methods into smaller, more manageable ones.

## Remove Dead Code

Eliminate unused code and redundant functions.

## DRY Principle

Avoid code duplication by abstracting common functionality.

## Boy Scout Rule

Always leave the codebase cleaner than you found it.
