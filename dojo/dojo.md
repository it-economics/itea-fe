# Coding Dojo Concept

## Core Concepts

1. Collaborative: Dojos are a collaborative game, not a competition.
2. Hands-On Practice: The aim is to train a technique and not to complete a kata.
3. Peer Feedback: Opportunity to receive constructive feedback and learn from each other.
4. Safe Environment: A non-judgmental space to try out new techniques and make mistakes.

## Katas

The term comes from martial arts, where katas are choreographed patterns of movements practiced repeatedly.
In a coding context, katas are used to refine techniques, explore new approaches, and reinforce good coding habits.
